All files except those contained within the raw_assets folder are distributed under MIT_LICENSE.txt

For files in the raw_assets directory, see the LICENSE.txt file contained in the same folder as the files it covers. 
For example: [.\raw_assets\images_icons\badges\LICENSE.txt] is the license which covers all files contained directly under the 
[.\raw_assets\images_icons\badges] folder, this does not include sub folders of [.\raw_assets\images_icons\badges].
