# godot_open_target_shooter
An open source third person shoot time trial game made with Godot 3.5 


Time trial shooting across 5 levels from a third person perspective. See how much you can beat the par times. Reduce your time by earning badges and hitting all enemy targets while avoiding friendly targets.

This project is part of a series of open source stepping stone projects I am creating, see my profile for others. The Godot project files are avaliable under the MIT license. Specific asset files have their own permissive licenses which can be found in the download folders. The Blender files for 3D assets are also available as a separate download under the CC BY 4.0 license on the itch page.
